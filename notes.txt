Lo muyayo requested that the data persistency will be simulated with an static JSON file, 
and also the session would be stored at memory level using Zustand (LaZustancia XD) which is 
closely related with the roles admin, editor & reader.

we also have the entities:
User {
    id,
    name,
    email,
    password,
    role
}
Book {
    id,
    title,
    author,
    year,
    tags[],
    userId,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt?
}
